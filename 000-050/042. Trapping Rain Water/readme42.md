### 🔁 First, here's the method again for context:

```java
public int trap(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0, water = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                leftMax = height[left];
            } else {
                water += leftMax - height[left];
            }
            left++;
        } else {
            if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                rightMax = height[right];
            } else {
                water += rightMax - height[right];
            }
            right--;
        }
    }

    return water;
}
```

## 🔍 WHY Behind Each Part

---

### `int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;`

**Why**:
We’re using two pointers (`left` and `right`) to start from both ends of the elevation map.
👉 Because trapped water depends on the **minimum of the maximums on both sides**, we need to evaluate both directions.

---

### `int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;`

**Why**:
We must track the highest wall seen so far **on each side** as we move inwards.
👉 These values represent the "walls" that could potentially hold water above a valley. Without these, we can’t know how much water can be trapped above each bar.

---

### `int water = 0;`

**Why**:
To keep a running total of the trapped water we collect as we move inward.
👉 It's our final result, built incrementally.

---

### `while (left < right)`

**Why**:
We move pointers toward each other and stop when they meet.
👉 Because once they cross, every possible position in the array has been processed, and no more water can be trapped.

---

### `if (height[left] < height[right])`

**Why**:
This is **the key insight**.
👉 The amount of water trapped depends on the shorter of the two sides.

If `height[left] < height[right]`, it means:

* The maximum water we can trap **at `left`** is based on `leftMax` only.
* Because even though there is a taller wall on the right, `leftMax` is the limiting factor **so far**.
* So we confidently process the `left` side, knowing it can’t trap more than `leftMax`.

If instead `height[right] <= height[left]`, we do the reverse logic on the right.

---

### `if (height[left] >= leftMax)`

**Why**:
We are updating our max so far on the left side.
👉 If the current bar is taller than any we’ve seen, it becomes the new wall. No water is trapped here.

---

### `else { water += leftMax - height[left]; }`

**Why**:
If the current height is **lower** than `leftMax`, then we are in a dip.
👉 Water is trapped = difference between current `leftMax` wall and the current lower height.

Same logic applies on the right when the opposite condition is triggered.

---

### `left++;` or `right--;`

**Why**:
After processing a side, we move inward.
👉 We’ve either updated the `max`, or added water, so that index is now fully handled.

---

### `return water;`

**Why**:
Return the total water trapped after going through every element.

---

## 🧠 Final Insight

This approach **relies entirely** on:

* The fact that water at any index is bounded by the **shorter wall** of the two sides.
* You only need to process the side with the shorter height at any moment.
* As you walk inwards, you keep track of the walls and only trap water where you're sure it’s enclosed.
