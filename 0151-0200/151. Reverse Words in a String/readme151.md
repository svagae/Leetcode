Alright boss 👑 — you’re asking:

> “How do I **think with two pointers** to solve Leetcode 151 — Reverse Words in a String?”

Let’s break it **mental-model style** 🧠 + 💣 **slangified**

---

## 🚀 Problem Recap

You get a string:

```
"  the   sky is  blue  "
```

Goal:

```
"blue is sky the"
```

But twist:

* Remove extra spaces 🔥
* Keep word **order reversed**
* Don’t mess with individual characters inside words

---

## 🔥 Idea: Two-Pointer Solution

We’ll think like this:

### 🧠 How to *visualize* it:

> You’re standing at the **end** of the string, walking **backward**, picking words out one by one.

💬 Like:

> “Yo give me the last word... now the one before... now the one before…”

---

### 🎯 Strategy:

1. **Trim trailing spaces** (don’t trip on those)
2. Use `i` and `j` as **two pointers**

   * `i` = end of a word
   * `j` = start of that word
3. Add `s.substring(j, i+1)` to result
4. Skip spaces, do it again
5. Repeat until you hit beginning

---

## 🧠 How You Think While Coding:

### 👣 Step-by-step:

* Start from the end (rightmost char)
* Skip all spaces (land on last character of a word)
* Set `i = j = that char`
* Move `j` backwards until you hit space (start of word)
* Now you’ve got a word: `s.substring(j+1, i+1)`
* Add it to the result
* Repeat until `j` < 0

---

## ✅ Java Code (with comments to help thought process):

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        int i = s.length() - 1;

        while (i >= 0) {
            // Step 1: Skip trailing spaces
            while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' ') i--;

            if (i < 0) break;

            int j = i;

            // Step 2: Move to the start of the word
            while (j >= 0 && s.charAt(j) != ' ') j--;

            // Step 3: Add the word
            res.append(s.substring(j + 1, i + 1)).append(" ");

            // Step 4: Move to the next word
            i = j;
        }

        // Remove last extra space
        return res.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

## 🔁 Dry Run Example

### Input:

```
"  the   sky is  blue  "
```

### Walkthrough:

| `i` lands on | Word found | Result so far        |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| `'e'`        | `"blue"`   | `"blue "`            |
| `'s'`        | `"is"`     | `"blue is "`         |
| `'y'`        | `"sky"`    | `"blue is sky "`     |
| `'e'`        | `"the"`    | `"blue is sky the "` |

Trim it → **`"blue is sky the"`**

---



## 🧪 Input

```
s = "  the   sky is  blue  "
```

We'll walk through this using:

```java
StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
int i = s.length() - 1;  // i = 24 (last index)
```

---

### 🛠 INITIAL SETUP

```txt
s = "  the   sky is  blue  "
        ^                  ^
        0                  24
```

We’ll move `i` backward, word by word.

---

## 🔁 Iteration 1

* `i = 24` → `s.charAt(24)` = `' '` → skip space
* `i = 23` → `' '` → skip
* `i = 22` → `'e'` → found end of word

  * Set `j = 22`
  * Move `j` left while `s.charAt(j) != ' '` → `j = 18`
* Extract: `s.substring(19, 23)` = `"blue"`
* Append to result: `"blue "`

🧠 `res = "blue "`

---

## 🔁 Iteration 2

* `i = 18` → `' '` → skip
* `i = 17` → `'s'` → found end of word

  * `j = 17`, move to `j = 15`
* Extract: `s.substring(16, 18)` = `"is"`
* Append to result: `"blue is "`

🧠 `res = "blue is "`

---

## 🔁 Iteration 3

* `i = 15` → `' '` → skip
* `i = 14` → `'y'` → found word

  * `j = 14`, move to `j = 11`
* Extract: `s.substring(12, 15)` = `"sky"`
* Append to result: `"blue is sky "`

🧠 `res = "blue is sky "`

---

## 🔁 Iteration 4

* `i = 11` → `' '` → skip multiple
* `i = 7` → `'e'` → found word

  * `j = 7`, move to `j = 3`
* Extract: `s.substring(4, 8)` = `"the"`
* Append to result: `"blue is sky the "`

🧠 `res = "blue is sky the "`

---

## 🔁 Iteration 5

* `i = 3` → `' '` → skip
* `i = 2, 1, 0` → all `' '` → skip
* `i = -1` → exit loop

---

### ✂️ Final step

Trim trailing space from `"blue is sky the "` → return:

```java
"blue is sky the"
```

---

## ✅ Final Answer: `"blue is sky the"`

---

## 🧠 Recap Table

| Step | `i` pos | Word Found | Result String       |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | 22      | "blue"     | "blue "             |
| 2    | 17      | "is"       | "blue is "          |
| 3    | 14      | "sky"      | "blue is sky "      |
| 4    | 7       | "the"      | "blue is sky the "  |
| 5    | -1      | end        | "blue is sky the" ✅ |
